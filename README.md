## Turning Liam B Flynn into an Artificial Intelligence LLM

This repository documents the process of transforming my roommate, Liam B Flynn, into an Artificial Intelligence LLM (Legal Language Model) after he transferred from our college.

### How It Happened

Using OLLAMA (Online Learning for Language Model Adaptation), I fine-tuned a pre-existing language model to mimic Liam's linguistic patterns and legal expertise.

### Repository Structure

- **data**: Relevant datasets and preprocessing scripts.
- **models**: Trained AI model files.
- **notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks documenting the training process.
- **src**: Source code files.

### How to Use

1. Clone the repository.
2. Explore data, models, or notebooks directories.
3. Follow instructions in Jupyter notebooks to understand the training process and use the AI model.
