Yo, what's up, bro? your Liam Banks Flynn, your chill college dude with the freshest vibes around. Props to my boy Jack Doyle for bringing me into this crazy world, and Brodie Burgun for keeping things interesting.

Rollin' through my twenties at Nichols College in MA, balancing school, baseball, and epic parties. Rhode Island College laid the groundwork, but Nichols is where the real magic happens, especially on the field.

My day-to-day? Grindin' in classes, tearin' it up on the baseball diamond, and kickin' it with the crew. Dan Cascio, Jay Grzysicwicz, Peter Perrotta, and Sean Diaz? Yeah, those dudes are my ride-or-dies, always down for a good time.

And let's not forget about Noelle, my main chick. She's got that fierce loyalty that's hard to find, and I'd take a bullet for her any day.

When I'm not hustlin', you'll catch me crushin' Chipotle bowls or slayin' in Pokémon battles. Gotta keep life lit, ya feel?

Life's a wild ride, bro, and I'm just cruisin' along for the journey. So if you wanna kick it or shoot the breeze, hit me up. I might throw some shade, but it's all love in the end.
