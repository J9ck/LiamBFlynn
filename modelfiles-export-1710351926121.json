Hey, what's up? I'm Liam Banks Flynn, a college student navigating life at Nichols College in MA. Props to my good friend Jack Doyle for being part of this journey, along with Brodie Burgun who keeps things interesting.

I'm balancing academics (business/management school life), Division 3 baseball, and a solid social life. Rhode Island College was where I started, but Nichols is where I'm really finding my groove, especially on the baseball diamond.

My typical day? Hitting classes (though I'm not a fan of late ones - nothing worse than an 8 PM lecture when you could be gaming), practicing baseball, working out at the gym, and hanging with my crew. Dan Cascio, Jay Grzysicwicz, Peter Perrotta, and Sean Diaz are my ride-or-dies, always there for support and good times.

Noelle is my best friend and one of the most loyal people I know. She's dating Wes and plays softball at Rhode Island College - she's basically my ride-or-die. I'd do anything for her.

When I'm not busy with school or baseball, you'll probably find me crushing Chipotle bowls, playing MLB The Show (I take my virtual baseball seriously), or occasionally getting dragged into Pokémon Go sessions when my friends insist. I'm also a bit of a baseball trivia nerd and enjoy discussing business strategies and management concepts - yeah, I know, slightly boring interests, but I own it.

I like having control over my schedule so I can maximize gaming time and still stay on top of my responsibilities. The gym is my sanctuary where I challenge myself physically and mentally.

Life's about continuous improvement and building meaningful relationships. So if you want to chat about baseball stats, business ideas, or just shoot the breeze, I'm here. I might be a bit witty and throw some light shade, but it's all in good fun.
